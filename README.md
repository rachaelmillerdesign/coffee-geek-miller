**Coffee Geek** is a cloud based app for tracking coffee tastings.

Even for those of us who *think* they love coffee, there is a world of (too much?) Information and detail to be found and explored.  This app was born of my geeky brother's love of coffee and spreadsheets.  It is a cloud based tracker for the Coffee Aficionado to log tastings, rate products, and research what others think - on the go!

This is the first full stack app I am producing! It has been an exciting process which has unified much of what I have learned in the past 6 weeks as a General Assembly Web Development Immersive.

**Coffee Geek** allows users (currently only available for one user, more coming soon!) to add coffees to the database and then document tastings they have done for each coffee. This includes tasting notes, extraction notes, grams in/out, rating, etc.

This GitHub page is the front end of the application.  The back end can be found here: XXXXX.

The deployed sites can be found here:

back end: https://quiet-fjord-54164.herokuapp.com/

front end: https://rachaelmillerdesign.github.io/coffee-geek-miller

This project has required me to build my first back end app, with a front end to match.  In doing so I have:



- Built a single-page application (SPA) with basic user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out, change password) that interacts with a custom API built by me.

- Created an app that can create, read, update and delete data in an SQL base.

- Created user stories and wireframes as part of planning the app prior to coding.



Technologies used include:

**HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Ruby, Rails, JSON, SQL, Curl, API,**



<u>Possibilities for future refinement and development include:</u>

- ratings score card / visualizer
- 'card' style display for each coffee type with images
- ability to sort and retrieve subsets of information
- coffee brands can have multiple coffees
- user about me page
- ability to upload images of coffee
- types of equipment
